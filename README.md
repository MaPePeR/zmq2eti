# zmq2eti

Can be connected to the [ODR-DabMux](https://github.com/Opendigitalradio/ODR-DabMux) ZMQ endpoint in order to get a cheap ETI output using a Raspberry PI.

***USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!***

It needs to be run as root and on a raspberry 2 or 3 (not tested on 4), that does not use audio output (so no `dtparam=audio=on` in `/boot/config.txt`).

The program will generate three signals on GPIOs:

* HDB+ on GPIO/BCM18 = PIN 12 (PWM0)
* HDB- on GPIO/BCM13 = PIN 33 (PWM1)
* GPIO/BCM27 = PIN 13 changes every 42 ETI Frames between HIGH and LOW to signal activity

In order to create an ETI Signal you need to attach a circuit that creates approximately +2.37V when HDB+ is HIGH and approximately -2.37V when HDB- is HIGH, 0V otherwise.
HDB+ and HDB- will be HIGH for about 244ns.

Sadly I was not able to create the circuit myself, so I cannot share it here. It used one XOR IC and a HCT125 as well as some passive components.
So if you have electrical knowledge and came up with a circuit matching the requirements please feel free to create a pull request.

> The physical parameters of ETI(NI, G.703) shall conform to the requirement of the ITU-T Recommendation G.703 [4] for 2 048 kbit/s interfaces. The minimum requirement shall be a 75 â„¦ female BNC connector fitted to the equipment.
